#Hacking the Visual Norm
##### About the different ways that you can take your data visualization beyond the default

In this repo you can find the slides and underlying code for my talk called "Hacking the Visual Norm". It might take a few seconds to load, but you should see something within Â±10 seconds (note that the presentation has a few CPU heavy slides, especially those with continuously moving objects).

####Please, please look at these slides in Chrome

Tested with Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Definitely meant to be seen in Chrome. Even more so at a resolution of 1920x1080

#####Notes

If you're looking at the presentation at a different resolution than 1920x1080 the text has the tendency to twitch whenever you click on the next arrow and an animation occurs within the same slide. Not sure why this is...

The slides are meant to be viewed in a forward direction. I tried to make all slides work while you click back as well, but there might be some things that don't run quite right.

If, for whatever strange reason, you don't want to use Chrome, here are some quirks with other browsers:

- Safari can't handle the moving slider in the "intro-slider", so I've deactivated the slider movement for Safari
- The same is true for the "intro-brush" slide where I'm just showing an entire rainbow instead of a sliding one in Safari
- The growing lines in the "intro-shopperdna" seem to disappear sometimes, haven't looked into why
- Never checked in IE, I'm guessing it would just be too horrible to look at...

Inside the slides folder you'll see another layer of folders. Here each slide has gotten its own folder, but the numbering is based on the order in which I made them and not on the order on which they appear on the screen (this you can find in the index.html file).

I've removed one slide that contained a movie about Adyen's shopperDNA where I couldn't blur some of the values visible. Also I've replaced the working demo of Adyen's interactive organogram with a movie showing the same things as I did during my presentation

I've used the code developed by [ptamarit](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/456) to use D3 (and D3 transitions) in RevealJS slides
